                        <b>Who am I?</b><br>
                        I'm Jakob Frick, a 19-year-old passionate developer from <b><span style="color: #FF533D">Sweden</span></b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Why do I write code?</b><br>
                        I've always strived to understand how things work. Whether it be in math, physics, or electronics, finding the reason behind why stuff works the way it does is very interesting to me, and when I first found the game <b><span style="color: #FF533D">Minecraft</span></b> back in 2010, I immediately wanted to know what was going on behind the scenes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Where did I start?</b><br>
                        I learned some basic Minecraft-environment specific <b><span style="color: #FF533D">Java</span></b> with the help of various modding forums, I managed to make a few mods, long since buried into obscurity. Despite the time I put into my mods, I never properly learned object orientation, actual Java features, or even basic programming. All I knew was Minecraft modding.
                    </p>
                    <p style="border-bottom: 0px solid white">
                        <b>How did I develop my skills?</b><br>
                        Turns out, there's a mod for Minecraft called <b><span style="color: #FF533D">ComputerCraft</span></b>. It adds computers to Minecraft, with a <b><span style="color: #FF533D">LUA</span></b>-based operating system integrated into them. This allows you to write your own programs and robots to perform various tasks for you. This is where I learned all about loops, arrays, functions, recursion, and a bunch of other cool basics.
                        The pilgrimage from the whitespace based syntax in LUA to <b><span style="color: #FF533D">Javascript</span></b> syntax, was a long, confusing and frustrating one, and the advance to object oriented programming with <b><span style="color: #FF533D">C#</span></b>, even more so.
